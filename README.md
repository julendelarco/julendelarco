### Hi there! 👋 I'm Julen.

_I'll be a web developer some day_

🦾I'm currently working on an internship doing a research project to make a robotic arm work and understanding the world of robotics and autonomous driving cars

👨‍💻 I know programming in these languages but I never stop learning:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Java
* Python

I like design and things looking fancy so I try to do everything I do beautiful.
